/*! \mainpage Presentation of libwired
 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * This is the source-code documentation of libwired. This library was created and 
 * is mainly intended for use by the Wired network suite. It contains collections 
 * and other data structures, and portable abstractions for many OS services, 
 * like threads, sockets, files, etc.
 *
 * libwired is written in ANSI-C to ensure portability for many operating systems. The 
 * programming interface is mainly written following object-oriented C techniques.
 * The implementation logic and vocabulary are very close to GNUstep/Cocoa APIs.
 *
 * The Wired protocol is a BBS-oriented network protocol (similar to Hotline, Carracho, 
 * KDX, etc.). It provides communication features like chat, messaging, and file 
 * tranfers in a very secure server/client architecture. 
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * \subsection OpenSSL
 *
 * http://www.openssl.org/source/
 *
 * \subsection libxml2
 *
 * http://xmlsoft.org/
 *
 * \subsection sqlite3
 *
 * http://www.sqlite.org/
 *
 *
 * \section Architecture
 *
 * The Wired library is composed of several logical modules.
 * 
 * \code
 * libwired/
 *     base/
 *     collections/
 *     crypto/
 *     data/
 *     file/
 *     misc/
 *     net/
 *     p7/
 *     system/
 *     thridparty/
 *     thread/
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection Base
 *
 * The base module mainly provides base types, functions and macros for the Wired
 * object-oriented runtime and library management.
 *
 * \subsection Collections
 *
 * The collection module regroups Wired classes to manage collections of objects,
 * like array, set, dictionary and their related object enumerating operations.
 *
 * \subsection Crypto
 *
 * The crypto module handles cryptographic features, mainly built around OpenSSL
 * and CommonCrypto libraries, in order to make the Wired network protocol secure.
 *
 * \subsection Data
 *
 * The data module regroups object representations of low-level data types like 
 * raw data, strings, dates, numbers, etc.
 *
 * \subsection File
 *
 * The data module provides file management features by taking care of operating
 * systems implemenations.
 *
 * \subsection Misc
 *
 * The misc module regroups miscellaneous classes used by the Wired library for
 * errors management, regular expressions, config files management, etc.
 *
 * \subsection Net
 *
 * The net module regroups low-level implementation for point-to-point network
 * communications using sockets.
 *
 * \subsection P7
 *
 * The p7 module regroups classes related to the network implementation of the 
 * Wired protocol version 2.0, based on a XML specification. 
 * 
 * \subsection System
 *
 * The system module provides an interface to interact with operating system
 * features like process, logs, tasks, terminal, etc.
 * 
 * \subsection Third-Party
 *
 * The thirdparty module regroups wrappers for third-party libraries. Here it 
 * is about libxml2 and sqlite3 libraries.
 *
 * \subsection Thread
 *
 * The thread module provides support for threads and locks based on pthread
 * library if this component is provided by the target operating system.
